# 100DaysOfCode Challenge Repository

Welcome to my 100DaysOfCode challenge repository! ðŸš€

## About

In this repository, I'll be documenting my journey as I commit to coding daily for the next 100 days. As part of this challenge, I will be taking on a **30ProjectsIn30Days** challenge. Each day, I will build a small project focusing on different programming languages and concepts, while also continuing to learn **Data Science** and **SQL** through dedicated 30-day challenges.

## Goals

- **30ProjectsIn30Days**: Build a new project each day, covering various topics and technologies.
- **Learn Data Science**: Explore machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and visualization.
- **Master SQL**: Dive deep into SQL queries, database structures, and data manipulation.
- **Document Progress**: Track daily progress across all challenges and showcase project work.

## Directory Structure

- **30DaysOfDataScience**: A dedicated 30-day challenge focusing on various data science concepts and practical implementations.
- **30DaysOfSQL**: A 30-day SQL challenge focusing on mastering database management and querying techniques.
- **30ProjectsIn30Days**: A directory where each day's project will be stored, with code and documentation.

## Progress

You can track my overall progress through the [daily logs](daily_logs.md). For specific challenges, check out:

- [30DaysOfDataScience](30DaysOfDataScience)
- [30DaysOfSQL](30DaysOfSQL)
- [30ProjectsIn30Days](30ProjectsIn30Days)

I'll be updating all logs regularly to showcase the tasks completed, challenges faced, and lessons learned each day.

## Contributions

Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated! If you have any suggestions, ideas, or if you'd like to collaborate on a project, feel free to open an [issue](issues) or submit a [pull request](pulls).

Let's code together and make the most of this 100DaysOfCode journey! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
