# 100DaysOfCode Challenge Repository

Welcome to my 100DaysOfCode challenge repository! 🚀

## About

In this repository, I'll be documenting my journey as I commit to coding daily for the next 100 days. My focus languages include Java ☕️, JavaScript 🌐, and Python 🐍. I'm excited to embark on this coding adventure, level up my skills, and build some amazing projects along the way!

## Progress

You can track my progress through the [daily logs](daily_logs.md) in this repository. I'll be updating it regularly to showcase the tasks completed, challenges faced, and lessons learned each day.

## Projects

I'll be working on a variety of projects using Java, JavaScript, and Python throughout the challenge. Feel free to explore the [projects](projects) directory to see what I'm currently working on and to check out the code.

## Contributions

Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated! If you have any suggestions, ideas, or if you'd like to collaborate on a project, feel free to open an [issue](issues) or submit a [pull request](pulls).

Let's code together and make the most of this 100DaysOfCode journey! 💻🔥
