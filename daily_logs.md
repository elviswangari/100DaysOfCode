## Day 1: October 15, 2024

### Progress

- Officially started the **100DaysOfCode** challenge, including **30ProjectsIn30Days**, **30DaysOfDataScience**, and **30DaysOfSQL**.
- Set up the project repository with directories for **30ProjectsIn30Days**, **30DaysOfDataScience**, and **30DaysOfSQL**.
- Built the first project: "Simple Todo App" in JavaScript.

### Tasks Completed

- Created a new structure for the repository to accommodate multiple challenges.
- Completed **Project 1** for **30ProjectsIn30Days**: A simple Todo app with basic CRUD operations.
- Completed Day 1 of **30DaysOfDataScience**: Introduction to Data Science and setting up the environment.
- Completed Day 1 of **30DaysOfSQL**: Reviewed SQL basics and simple SELECT queries.

### Lessons Learned

- Refreshed my knowledge on data science fundamentals such as data preprocessing and visualization techniques.
- Learned how to execute basic SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data from databases.
- Improved my understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation while building the Todo app.

### Challenges Faced

- Debugging issues in the Todo app related to dynamic element creation and event listeners.
- Took some time to integrate both challenges and projects smoothly into a single repository structure.

### Next Steps

- Day 2 of **30DaysOfDataScience**: Cover data types (structured, unstructured, and semi-structured) and data collection methods (surveys, APIs, web scraping).
- Day 2 of **30DaysOfSQL**: Dive deeper into JOIN operations and multi-table queries.
- **Project 2**: Build a weather dashboard app using API data.
